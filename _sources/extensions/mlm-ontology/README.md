# STAC Machine Learning Model (MLM) Extension Ontology

This building block defines the **ontology** (RDF vocabulary) for the elements introduced by the
[STAC MLM extension](https://github.com/stac-extensions/mlm).

## Purpose

To provide Linked Data support for the STAC MLM extension by giving each `mlm:*` field, and the
ModelInput/ModelOutput/InputStructure/ResultStructure/ValueScaling structures it defines, a resolvable
term with a definition, so that STAC data mapped through the extension's JSON-LD context can be
interpreted as RDF.

## Scope

Describes **only** the elements the MLM extension itself adds: model identity (`mlm:name`,
`mlm:architecture`), task/framework/accelerator requirements, `mlm:input`/`mlm:output` and their nested
structures. STAC Item and Collection are defined by the STAC **core** vocabulary and are reused, not
redefined.

Two deliberate reuses instead of redefinitions:

- `ModelOutput`'s `classification:classes` field reuses the **STAC Classification extension**'s own term
  (already an MLM dependency) — MLM does not mint a second definition of it.
- `mlm:pre_processing_function` / `mlm:post_processing_function` are declared
  `rdfs:subPropertyOf processing:expression` (**STAC Processing extension**) to record that they share its
  Expression Object shape, without literally being the same JSON property.

`mlm:input` and `mlm:output` link a STAC Item or Collection to its `mlm:ModelInput` and
`mlm:ModelOutput` descriptions. Within those descriptions, `mlm:bands` contains ordered names or
references to the corresponding STAC Asset band metadata. Those referenced band definitions may use
STAC common metadata and the EO and Raster extension fields. Likewise, `mlm:variables` contains
ordered keys into the applicable Datacube `cube:variables` map; those variable definitions may refer
to `cube:dimensions`. These are reference relationships, not `owl:equivalentProperty` relationships:
the MLM fields identify which bands or variables the model consumes or produces, while the other
extensions describe those data objects.

## Interaction graph

The following graph shows the intended traversal through an MLM resource and the related STAC
extensions. A string in `mlm:bands` or `mlm:variables` is a name lookup; an object entry is
represented by `mlm:BandVariableReference`.

The `bands` and `variables` arrays preserve model channel/variable order. When present, the
corresponding `mlm:dim_order` list uses `bands` and/or `variables` to identify those tensor axes.
The ontology does not assert that `mlm:bands` is equivalent to `eo:bands` or `raster:bands`:
those extensions describe the referenced STAC data, whereas MLM selects the data used by the model.

The JSON field names and the RDF predicate names must not be confused. At Item/Collection level, the
MLM JSON property is `mlm:name`; inside an `input` or `output` object, the JSON member is simply
`name` (without an `mlm:` prefix). The JSON-LD context maps the nested member to the distinct RDF
predicate `mlm:io_name`, while the top-level property maps to `mlm:name`. Similarly, nested
`description`, `input`, `type`, and `value` members map to `mlm:io_description`,
`mlm:input_structure`, `mlm:scaling_type`, and `mlm:scaling_value`. This preserves the distinct
concepts in RDF while keeping the JSON serialization aligned with the MLM schema. No fictitious JSON
property named `mlm:name` is introduced inside a nested object.

## Cross-resource SHACL validation

The ontology includes SHACL constraints for relationships that the MLM JSON Schema cannot validate
because they depend on multiple resources or on ordered RDF structures:

- each `mlm:variables` reference on an input or output must resolve to a key in the enclosing
  Datacube `cube:variables` map;
- each dimension named by a Datacube variable must resolve to a key in that resource's
  `cube:dimensions` map;
- an asset carrying `mlm:artifact_type` must also carry the STAC `mlm:model` asset role;
- nested MLM input/output structures and band/variable reference objects receive their applicable
  field-level shape checks.

The schema-specific context preserves Datacube JSON map keys as
`mlm:datacube_variable_name` and `mlm:datacube_dimension_name` so those references remain
available to SHACL without changing the standalone Datacube block. These predicates are uplift
implementation terms, not replacements for Datacube's `cube:variables` or `cube:dimensions`
properties. Band-name resolution is intentionally not asserted here because the current STAC EO and
Raster RDF mappings do not provide one authoritative, interoperable RDF predicate for every form of
asset band name.

## SKOS vs. OWL

Five MLM fields are genuine (mostly closed) enumerations and are modeled as `skos:ConceptScheme`s in
`skos.ttl`: `mlm:TaskScheme`, `mlm:AcceleratorScheme`, `mlm:ResizeTypeScheme` and
`mlm:ValueScalingTypeScheme` are closed; `mlm:FrameworkScheme` is marked non-exhaustive because the
extension also accepts free-text framework names. `mlm:dim_order` lists common values in a comment but is
**not** modeled as SKOS, since the extension does not close that list. Everything else — model metadata,
the ModelInput/ModelOutput/InputStructure/ResultStructure/ValueScaling classes and their non-enumerated
properties — is plain OWL, in `owl.ttl`.

## File layout

- `skos.ttl` — the five concept schemes above.
- `owl.ttl` — the `mlm:*` properties and classes.
- `ontology.ttl` — the combined file (the one the register tooling loads/publishes).
